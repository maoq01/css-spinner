# css-spinner
(Almost) pure CSS spinner with checkmark animation (on load complete).

Consists of three parts:
- a loading spinner with an infinite rotate animation
- two half-circle animations for a clockwise fill of the circle
- a circle that is filled from the outer edge and a checkmark that appears in the middle
